So here we are. I've finally set up my own space on the web using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. It's been on my mind for a while, and I'm excited to have a place to put down thoughts, document what I'm learning, and share stuff as I go.

**What's this site for?** Mostly Platform Engineering: the tools, practices, and ideas that make building and operating systems a bit saner. I'll be posting about projects I'm working on, things I'm figuring out, and hopefully passing along useful bits as I learn them. Think of it as informal notes that might help someone else (or future me) down the line.

I'm not aiming for anything too polished here, just a place to write, learn in public, and occasionally teach what I've picked up. If that sounds like your vibe, stick around.

**Want to create your own?** Here are helpful links to get started:

- [GitHub Pages documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) — Official guide to hosting sites on GitHub
- [GitHub Pages with Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) — Step-by-step setup for Jekyll sites
- [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) — Static site generator docs and guides
- [Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) — The default Jekyll theme (what this site uses)

More to come.
