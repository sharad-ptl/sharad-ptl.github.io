So here we are. I've finally set up my own space on the web using GitHub Pages and Jekyll. It's been on my mind for a while, and I'm excited to have a place to put down thoughts, document what I'm learning, and share stuff as I go.

**What's this site for?** Mostly Platform Engineering: the tools, practices, and ideas that make building and operating systems a bit saner. I'll be posting about projects I'm working on, things I'm figuring out, and hopefully passing along useful bits as I learn them. Think of it as informal notes that might help someone else (or future me) down the line.

I'm not aiming for anything too polished here, just a place to write, learn in public, and occasionally teach what I've picked up. If that sounds like your vibe, stick around.

More to come.
