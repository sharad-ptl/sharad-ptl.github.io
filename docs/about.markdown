I'm building this site as a place to write about Platform Engineering and related topics as I learn, work on projects, and teach what I pick up along the way.

You'll find informal blog posts here: notes from projects, things I'm figuring out, and the occasional how-to or writeup that might be useful to someone else.

If that sounds useful, have a look around. You can find more of my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/sharad-ptl).
